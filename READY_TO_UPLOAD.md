## 💡 Tips

### For Better Results
1. Increase epochs to 20-50 in `configs.py`
2. Add more training images (50-200)
3. Use GPU for faster training
4. Monitor training progress

### For Sharing
1. Make repository PUBLIC
2. Add topics: `deep-learning`, `watermarking`, `cnn`, `tensorflow`
3. Add a nice description
4. Star your own repo 😊

### For Collaboration
1. Enable Issues in repository settings
2. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md (already included)
3. Respond to issues and PRs
4. Keep documentation updated

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" in Colab
- Make sure repository is PUBLIC
- Check the URL is correct
- Wait a few minutes after pushing

### "Permission denied" when pushing
- Check your GitHub credentials
- Use personal access token instead of password
- Or use SSH keys

### "Files too large"
- Don't commit model weights or datasets
- Check `.gitignore` is working
- Use Git LFS for large files if needed
